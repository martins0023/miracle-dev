# Beyond the Bootcamp

Graduating from **AltSchool Africa** with a diploma in Frontend Engineering was a milestone. It gave me the technical foundation—React, JavaScript, CSS. But stepping into the professional world required a different set of skills.

## 1. Reading Code > Writing Code

In my first major project, I spent 70% of my time reading existing codebases and only 30% writing new features. 

> Junior engineers rush to write. Senior engineers rush to understand.

## 2. System Design

Bootcamps teach you how to build a component. Experience teaches you how to structure a scalable system. 

I learned to ask questions before coding:
* How will this state management scale?
* Is this component reusable?
* What are the security implications of this API call?

## 3. The "Soft" Skills

Communication is the most underrated engineering skill. Being able to explain *why* a feature will take 3 days instead of 1 day to a non-technical stakeholder is invaluable.
