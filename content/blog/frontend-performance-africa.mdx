# The Reality of Internet in Emerging Markets

Building **doctorkays.com** presented a unique challenge. Unlike testing on a Gigabit connection in London, our users in Nigeria often access the web via 3G mobile networks with high latency.

A 5MB JavaScript bundle isn't just "slow" here—it's a bounce rate of 90%.

## Strategy 1: Aggressive Code Splitting

We used Next.js dynamic imports to break the application into tiny chunks. The video consultation module, which is heavy (WebRTC libraries), is never loaded until the user actually enters a consultation room.

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const VideoRoom = dynamic(() => import('@/components/VideoRoom'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading secure connection...</p>,
  ssr: false, // WebRTC doesn't work on server anyway
})
